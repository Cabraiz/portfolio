3. **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge the receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for the assessment.
4. **Assessment**: Our security team will assess the vulnerability's impact and validity. We may reach out to you for additional information during this process.
5. **Patch and Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is validated, our team will work on developing a patch to address the issue. The timeline for the patch release will depend on the complexity of the vulnerability. We will keep you informed of the progress.
6. **Security Update Release**: After the patch is ready, we will release a security update for the affected supported versions. We will also provide an advisory to our users about the vulnerability and the steps to update their installations.
